# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries. 

## Objectives

1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: The project starts by creating a database named `sql_project_1`.
- **Table Creation**: A table named `retail_sales` is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE sql_project_1;

CREATE TABLE retail_sales
(
    transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE,	
    sale_time TIME,
    customer_id INT,	
    gender VARCHAR(10),
    age INT,
    category VARCHAR(35),
    quantity INT,
    price_per_unit FLOAT,	
    cogs FLOAT,
    total_sale FLOAT
);
```

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.

  ```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM retail_sales;
SELECT DISTINCT category FROM retail_sales;
```
 ```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;

DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    sale_date IS NULL OR sale_time IS NULL OR customer_id IS NULL OR 
    gender IS NULL OR age IS NULL OR category IS NULL OR 
    quantity IS NULL OR price_per_unit IS NULL OR cogs IS NULL;
```

### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:

--Qn 1 - Retrieve all sales made on 2022-11-05

  ```sql
 SELECT * FROM retail_sales
 WHERE sale_date = '2022-11-05' AND category = 'Clothing'
```


 --Qn 2 - retrieve all transactions where category is Clothing and quantity sold is more than 10 in Nov 2022

  ```sql
 SELECT *,
 quantity as quantity_sold
 FROM retail_sales
 WHERE category = 'Clothing' AND FORMAT(sale_date,'yyyy-MM') ='2022-11'
```


 -- Qn 3 - write a query to calculate the total_sales for each category

  ```sql
 SELECT category, SUM(total_sale) as total_sales, COUNT(*) orders
 FROM retail_sales 
 GROUP BY
 category
 ```

 -- Qn 4 write a query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from 'Beauty' category

  ```sql
 SELECT category, AVG(age) as average_age
 FROM retail_sales
 GROUP BY 
 category
 HAVING
 category = 'Beauty'
```

 -- Qn 5 write a query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000

  ```sql
 SELECT * FROM retail_sales
 WHERE total_sale > 1000
```

 --Qn 6 write a query to find the total number of transactions made by each gender

  ```sql
	SELECT category,gender, COUNT(transaction_id) as total_transactions 
	FROM retail_sales
	GROUP BY 
	category,gender
	ORDER BY
	category
```

-- Qn 7 write a query to calculate the avg sale for each month and find out the best selling month in each year

  ```sql
SELECT YEAR(sale_date) as sale_year,
       MONTH(sale_date) as sale_month,
	   ROUND(AVG(total_sale),2) as avg_total_sales
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY YEAR(sale_date),
       MONTH(sale_date) 
ORDER BY 
     YEAR(sale_date),
	 avg_total_sales DESC
```

 -- Qn 8 write a query to find the top 5 customers based on highest total sales

  ```sql
 SELECT TOP 5 customer_id,SUM(total_sale) as total_sales FROM retail_sales
 GROUP BY
 customer_id
 ORDER BY
 total_sales DESC
```
 -- Qn 9 write a query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category

  ```sql
 SELECT category,COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) as unique_customers
 FROM retail_sales
 GROUP BY category
 ORDER BY category ASC
```

--Qn 10 write a sql query to create each shift and number of orders (example morning <= 12,)

  ```sql
SELECT *,
	CASE 
	   WHEN DATEPART(HOUR,sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
	   WHEN DATEPART(HOUR,sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon' 
	   ELSE 'Evening'
	END as shift_
FROM retail_sales



SELECT
     CASE 
	   WHEN DATEPART(HOUR,sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
	   WHEN DATEPART(HOUR,sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon' 
	   ELSE 'Evening'
	END as shift_,
	COUNT(transaction_id) as number_of_orders FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 
CASE 
	   WHEN DATEPART(HOUR,sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
	   WHEN DATEPART(HOUR,sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon' 
	   ELSE 'Evening'
	END



	--end of project
```
